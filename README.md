# Installing-Windows-and-Ubuntu-in-Lenovo
A guide to install Ubuntu alongside Windows in Lenovo platforms.

# Background
I acquired a Lenovo Legion Y730 17" a few months ago. Everything was working perfectly, until I tried to install Ubuntu for academic purposes. Every time installing Ubuntu at the momement of selecting "install alongside windows" popped up:

*Force UEFI Installation? This machine's firmware has started the installer in UEFI mode but it looks like there may be existing operating systems already installed using "BIOS compatibility mode". If you continue to install Debian in UEFI mode, it might be difficult to reboot the machine into any BIOS-mode operating systems later.*

*If you wish to install in UEFI mode and don't care about keeping the ability to boot one of the existing systems, you have the option to force that here. If you wish to keep the option to boot an existing operating system, you should choose NOT to force UEFI installation here.*
